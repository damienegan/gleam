General Lightweight Enterprise Architectural Model

Enterprise Architecture (EA) defines how information and technology assets support the organisation's business processes and leads enterprise responses to disruptive forces by identifying and analysing the execution of change toward a desired business vision and outcomes.

It is important to note that the impact of EA on business outcomes is indirect. The business outcomes are actually achieved through various initiatives and projects which need to be guided by EA to ensure that the projects succeed not only individually, but also together.

EA is concerned with the whole enterprise and not just IT.

By identifying how information and technology assets enable various business processes and how those processes contribute to the organisation's strategy, EA helps promote IT solutions that are more relevant for the business.

Effective EA requires the following â€“ 
Strong executive commitment, understanding and support
Effective collaboration with various project, solution and portfolio owners
Strong communication with business and technical subject matter experts

gleam is an EA model/framework/practice which is agile and lightweight and helps to control costs and complexity.

gleam is intended to be business-outcome driven and is not concerned with documenting legacy solutions.

gleam provides just want is needed to help create and maintain new solutions over time.

gleam is built on the following core:

* EA Principles 
* EA Guidance
* EA Domains

# EA Principles
* Drive architecture based on business needs
* Ensure business continuity
* Redesign business processes before solution design
* Treat information as a valuable organizational asset
* Ensure information security, privacy and confidentiality
* Use common global solutions
* Use proven standards and technologies
* Design application programming interfaces and inter-operable solutions
* Design and build solutions according to our enterprise architecture guidance
* Design solutions with a cloud first, mobile first mindset

# EA Guidance
* Quality Pillars
* Master Data Management
* Solution Design Guidelines
* Architectural Styles
* Design Patterns
* Reference Models
* API Design Guidelines
* Twelve Factors for modern cloud applications

# EA Domains
* Business Architecture
* Solution Architecture
* Digital Architecture

# Combining the Principles, Guidelines and Domains
* The Business Architecture supplies the Solution Architecture with high-level requirements.
* The Digital Architecture is continuously built and improved from a number of artefacts, either from establised policies, standards and guidelines and/or from improved outputs from new solutions, services and products. 
* The Solution Architecture combines the EA Principles and Guidleines with the Business Architecture and the Digital Architecture to provide a solution to the business. Solutions can be delivered through a Project and Portfolio Management Practice, usually contributing to a Solutions Portfolio and Service Catalogue.
* The various elements of the Digital Architecture are independent components and can change over time. The various elements of the EA Guidance will also update and change over time. The EA principles remain mostly constant.
